[DS-379]

The rocket ripped the inky void of space at [] miles per hour, a bullet of hopeful humanity, a speck of polished metal in the swallowing black. Long ago had the last glimmering spiral galaxy, the final binary star system dancing their quick jig, the terminal asteroid colder than Winter's icy grasp, passed in the river of time trailing behind it. Now there was just a great empty swallowing blackness, thoroughly consuming it.

"I still need to finish auditing this data.

"Well, lets just say I want to be absolutely sure of this before it gets sent back down to control."

"Come on Scheer, it can wait until tomorrow, it's not like those damned researchers are staying late down on Earth are they? They're all at home right now with their wives and families eating fresh food, or out at a bar reminiscing on the golden days with their friends. All those things we've been deprived of for so long. So who cares now, they can wait until morning. Let's get some food."
